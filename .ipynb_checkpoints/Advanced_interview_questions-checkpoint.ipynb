It allows you to restrict access to the inner workings of an object and only expose the necessary functionality or interface to interact with it.\n",

    "- **Access Control:** Encapsulation allows you to control how the data is accessed and manipulated. By defining methods (such as getters, setters, and other utility methods) within the class, you can provide controlled access to the object's attributes while enforcing constraints or performing validation checks.\n",
    "\n",
