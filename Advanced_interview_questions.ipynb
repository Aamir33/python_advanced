It allows you to restrict access to the inner workings of an object and only expose the necessary functionality or interface to interact with it.\n",

    "- **Data Hiding:** The internal state of an object (its data) is hidden from the outside world, and access to it is restricted. This is typically achieved by making attributes private or protected, which means they can only be accessed or modified from within the class itself.\n",

    "- **Access Control:** Encapsulation allows you to control how the data is accessed and manipulated. By defining methods (such as getters, setters, and other utility methods) within the class, you can provide controlled access to the object's attributes while enforcing constraints or performing validation checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity:** Encapsulation promotes modularity by grouping related data and behavior together in a single unit (the class). This makes it easier to understand and maintain the codebase, as each class encapsulates a distinct set of responsibilities or functionalities.\n",
