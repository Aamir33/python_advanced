As such, this course\\nrepresents an important opportunity for students to\\ndevelop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to\\nmake informed decisions as they continue with their\\nlives. Rather than being mired down with facts and\\nvocabulary, the typical non-science major student\\nneeds information presented in a way that is easy to\\nread and understand. Even more importantly, the\\ncontent should be meaningful. Students do much\\nbetter when they understand why biology is relevant to\\ntheir everyday lives. For these reasons, Concepts of\\nBiology is grounded on an evolutionary basis and\\nincludes exciting features that highlight careers in the\\nbiological sciences and everyday applications of the\\nconcepts at hand. We also strive to show the\\ninterconnectedness of topics within this extremely\\nbroad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s\\ninstructors and students, we maintain the overall\\norganization and coverage found in most syllabi for this\\ncourse. A strength of Concepts of Biology is that\\ninstructors can customize the book, adapting it to the\\napproach that works best in their classroom. Concepts\\nof Biology also includes an innovative art program that\\nincorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to\\nhelp students understand—and apply—key concepts.\\nPreface\\n1\\nCoverage and Scope\\nOur Concepts of Biology textbook adheres to the scope\\nand sequence of most one-semester non-majors\\ncourses nationwide. We also strive to make biology, as\\na discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In\\naddition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts\\nand foundational research, we have incorporated\\nfeatures that draw learners into the discipline in\\nmeaningful ways. Our scope of content was developed\\nafter surveying over a hundred biology professors and\\nlistening to their coverage needs. We provide a\\nthorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts\\nwith a scope that is manageable for instructors and\\nstudents alike.\\n•\\nUnit 1: The Cellular Foundation of Life. Our\\nopening unit introduces students to the sciences,\\nincluding the process of science and the\\nunderlying concepts from the physical sciences\\nthat provide a framework within which learners\\ncomprehend biological processes. Additionally,\\nstudents will gain solid understanding of the\\nstructures, functions, and processes of the most\\nbasic unit of life: the cell.\\n•\\nUnit 2: Cell Division and Genetics. Our genetics\\nunit takes learners from the foundations of cellular\\nreproduction to the experiments that revealed the\\nbasis of genetics and laws of inheritance.\\n•\\nUnit 3: Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.\\nStudents will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein\\nsynthesis, and gene regulation and current\\napplications of biotechnology and genomics.\\n•\\nUnit 4: Evolution and the Diversity of Life. The\\ncore concepts of evolution are discussed in this\\nunit with examples illustrating evolutionary\\nprocesses. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of\\nbiology reappears throughout the textbook in\\ngeneral discussion and is reinforced through\\nspecial call-out features highlighting specific\\nevolution-based topics. The diversity of life is\\nexplored with detailed study of various organisms\\nand discussion of emerging phylogenetic\\nrelationships between and among bacteria, protist\\nkingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals.\\n•\\nUnit 5: Animal Structure and Function. An\\nintroduction to the form and function of the animal\\nbody is followed by chapters on the immune\\nsystem and animal development. This unit touches\\non the biology of all organisms while maintaining\\nan engaging focus on human anatomy and\\nphysiology that helps students connect to the\\ntopics.\\n•\\nUnit 6: Ecology. Ecological concepts are broadly\\ncovered in this unit, with features highlighting\\nlocalized, real-world issues of conservation and\\nbiodiversity.\\nPedagogical Foundation and Features\\nBecause of the impact science has on students and\\nsociety, an important goal of science education is to\\nachieve a scientifically literate population that\\nconsistently makes informed decisions. Scientific\\nliteracy transcends a basic understanding of scientific\\nprinciples and processes to include the ability to make\\nsense of the myriad instances where people encounter\\nscience in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate\\nperson is one who uses science content knowledge to\\nmake informed decisions, either personally or socially,\\nabout topics or issues that have a connection with\\nscience. Concepts of Biology is grounded on a solid\\nscientific base and designed to promote scientific\\nliteracy. Throughout the text, you will find features that\\nengage the students in scientific inquiry by taking\\nselected topics a step further.\\n•\\nEvolution Connection features uphold the\\nimportance of evolution to all biological study\\nthrough discussions like “Global Decline of Coral\\nReefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis.”\\n•\\nCareer Connection features present information\\non a variety of careers in the biological sciences,\\nintroducing students to the educational\\nrequirements and day-to-day work life of a variety\\nof professions, such as forensic scientists,\\nregistered dietitians, and biogeographers.\\n•\\nEveryday Connection features tie biological\\nconcepts to emerging issues and discuss science\\nin terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive\\nSpecies” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery\\nStore.”\\nAnswers to Questions in the Book\\nAnswers to Visual Connection Questions, Review\\nQuestions, and Critical Thinking Questions are provided\\nin the Instructor Answer Guide via the Instructor\\nResources page. Select answers to these questions are\\nprovided for students via the Student Resources page.\\nArt and Animations that Engage\\nOur art program takes a straightforward approach\\ndesigned to help students learn the concepts of biology\\nthrough simple, effective illustrations, photos, and\\nmicrographs. Concepts of Biology also incorporates\\nlinks to relevant animations and interactive exercises\\nthat help bring biology to life for students.\\n•\\nVisual Connection features call out core figures in\\neach chapter for student attention. Questions\\nabout key figures, including clicker questions that\\ncan be used in the classroom, engage students’\\n2\\nPreface\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\ncritical thinking and analytical abilities to ensure\\ntheir genuine understanding of the concept at\\nhand.\\n•\\nLink to Learning features direct students to online\\ninteractive exercises and animations to add a fuller\\ncontext and examples to core content.\\nAbout Our Team\\nConcepts of Biology would not be possible if not for the\\ntremendous contributions of the authors and\\ncommunity reviewing team\\nSenior Contributing Authors\\nSamantha Fowler, Clayton State University\\nRebecca Roush, Sandhills Community College\\nJames Wise, Hampton University\\nContributing Authors and Reviewers\\nMark Belk, Brigham Young University\\nLisa Boggs, Southwestern Oklahoma State University\\nSherryl Broverman, Duke University\\nDavid Byres, Florida State College at Jacksonville\\nAaron Cassill, The University of Texas at San Antonio\\nKaren Champ, College of Central Florida\\nSue Chaplin, University of St. Thomas\\nDiane Day, Clayton State University\\nJean DeSaix, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\\nDavid Hunnicutt, St. Norbert College\\nBarbara Kuehner, Hawaii Community College\\nBrenda Leady, University of Toledo\\nBernie Marcus, Genesee Community College\\nFlora Mhlanga, Lipscomb University\\nMadeline Mignone, Dominican College\\nElizabeth Nash, Long Beach City College\\nMark Newton, San Jose City College\\nDiana Oliveras, University of Colorado Boulder\\nAnn Paterson, Williams Baptist College\\nJoel Piperberg, Millersville University\\nNick Reeves, Mt.

The first forms of life on Earth are thought to have been microorganisms\\nthat existed for billions of years before plants and animals appeared. The mammals, birds, and\\nflowers so familiar to us are all relatively recent, originating 130 to 200 million years ago. Humans\\nhave inhabited this planet for only the last 2.5 million years, and only in the last 300,000 years\\nhave humans started looking like we do today.\\n1.1 Themes and Concepts of Biology\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n•\\nIdentify and describe the properties of life\\n•\\nDescribe the levels of organization among living things\\n•\\nList examples of different sub disciplines in biology\\nBiology is the science that studies life. What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question\\nwith an obvious answer, but it is not easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called\\nvirology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others.\\nIt turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce,\\nFIGURE 1.1 This NASA image is a composite of several satellite-based views of Earth. To make the whole-Earth\\nimage, NASA scientists combine observations of different parts of the planet. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\\nCHAPTER OUTLINE\\nthey do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.\\nFrom its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared\\nproperties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced\\nwith the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that\\nwe can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how\\ndid this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day,\\nbiologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.\\nProperties of Life\\nAll groups of living organisms share several key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or\\nresponse to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation/homeostasis,\\nenergy processing, and evolution. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to\\ndefine life.\\nOrder\\nOrganisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple,\\nsingle-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules.\\nThese in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist\\nof millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells\\ncan be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the\\ngood of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such\\nas the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown in Figure 1.2 will be discussed later.\\nFIGURE 1.2 A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.\\n(credit: \"Ivengo(RUS)\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nSensitivity or Response to Stimuli\\nOrganisms respond to diverse stimuli. For example, plants can bend toward a source of light or\\nrespond to touch (Figure 1.3). Even tiny bacteria can move toward or away from chemicals (a\\nprocess called chemotaxis) or light (phototaxis). Movement toward a stimulus is considered a\\npositive response, while movement away from a stimulus is considered a negative response.\\n6\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.3 The leaves of this sensitive plant (Mimosa pudica) will instantly droop and fold when touched. After a few minutes, the plant\\nreturns to its normal state.

Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more\\nthan one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA\\ncontaining genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will\\nbelong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type.\\nAdaptation\\nAll living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a\\nconsequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples\\nof adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue\\nlength of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. Adaptations enhance the\\nreproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations\\nare not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a\\npopulation to track those changes.\\nGrowth and Development\\nOrganisms grow and develop according to specific instructions coded for by their genes. These genes provide\\ninstructions that will direct cellular growth and development, ensuring that a species’ young (Figure 1.4) will grow\\nup to exhibit many of the same characteristics as its parents.\\n1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology\\n7\\nFIGURE 1.4 Although no two look alike, these kittens have inherited genes from both parents and share many of the same characteristics.\\n(credit: Pieter & Renée Lanser)\\nRegulation/Homeostasis\\nEven the smallest organisms are complex and require multiple regulatory mechanisms to coordinate internal\\nfunctions, such as the transport of nutrients, response to stimuli, and coping with environmental stresses.\\nHomeostasis (literally, “steady state”) refers to the relatively stable internal environment required to maintain life.\\nFor example, organ systems such as the digestive or circulatory systems perform specific functions like carrying\\noxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.\\nTo function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of\\ndiverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to\\nmaintain homeostatic internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes,\\nby activation of regulatory mechanisms. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process\\nknown as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear (Figure 1.5), have body\\nstructures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have\\nmethods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.\\nFIGURE 1.5 Polar bears and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducing\\nheat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin. (credit: \"longhorndave\"/Flickr)\\nEnergy Processing\\nAll organisms (such as the California condor shown in Figure 1.6) use a source of energy for their metabolic\\nactivities. Some organisms capture energy from the Sun and convert it into chemical energy in food; others use\\nchemical energy from molecules they take in.\\n8\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.6 A lot of energy is required for a California condor to fly.

(credit: Pacific Southwest Region U.S. Fish and Wildlife)\\nEvolution\\nThe diversity of life on Earth is a result of mutations, or random changes in hereditary material over time. These\\nmutations allow the possibility for organisms to adapt to a changing environment. An organism that evolves\\ncharacteristics fit for the environment will have greater reproductive success, subject to the forces of natural\\nselection.\\nLevels of Organization of Living Things\\nLiving things are highly organized and structured, following a hierarchy on a scale from small to large. The atom is\\nthe smallest and most fundamental unit of matter that retains the properties of an element. It consists of a nucleus\\nsurrounded by electrons. Atoms form molecules. A molecule is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms\\nheld together by a chemical bond. Many molecules that are biologically important are macromolecules, large\\nmolecules that are typically formed by combining smaller units called monomers. An example of a macromolecule is\\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Figure 1.7), which contains the instructions for the functioning of the organism that\\ncontains it.\\n1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology\\n9\\nFIGURE 1.7 A molecule, like this large DNA molecule, is composed of atoms. (credit: \"Brian0918\"/Wikimedia Commons)\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nTo see an animation of this DNA molecule, click here (http://openstax.org/l/rotating_DNA2).\\nSome cells contain aggregates of macromolecules surrounded by membranes; these are called organelles.\\nOrganelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions. All living things are made of\\ncells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement\\nis why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and\\nhijack a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a\\nsingle cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-\\ncelled organisms that lack organelles surrounded by a membrane and do not have nuclei surrounded by nuclear\\nmembranes; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei.\\nIn most multicellular organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the\\nsame function. Organs are collections of tissues grouped together based on a common function. Organs are present\\nnot only in animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally\\nrelated organs. For example vertebrate animals have many organ systems, such as the circulatory system that\\ntransports blood throughout the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood\\nvessels. Organisms are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled\\nprokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as\\nmicroorganisms.\\n10\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\nFIGURE 1.8 From an atom to the entire Earth, biology examines all aspects of life.

For example, a forest\\nmay include many white pine trees. All of these pine trees represent the population of white pine trees in this forest.\\nDifferent populations may live in the same specific area. For example, the forest with the pine trees includes\\npopulations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A community is the set of populations\\ninhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the\\nforest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular\\narea together with the abiotic, or non-living, parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rainwater. At\\nthe highest level of organization (Figure 1.8), the biosphere is the collection of all ecosystems, and it represents the\\nzones of life on Earth. It includes land, water, and portions of the atmosphere.\\nThe Diversity of Life\\nThe science of biology is very broad in scope because there is a tremendous diversity of life on Earth. The source of\\nthis diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species.\\nEvolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.\\nIn the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing the known species of organisms into a\\nhierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together within a grouping\\nknown as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together within a family. This grouping\\ncontinues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest level. The current taxonomic system\\nnow has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest, they are: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum,\\nkingdom, domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are grouped within families, families are grouped\\nwithin orders, and so on (Figure 1.9).\\nFIGURE 1.9 This diagram shows the levels of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest category—domain—to the most\\nspecific—species.\\nThe highest level, domain, is a relatively new addition to the system since the 1970s. Scientists now recognize three\\ndomains of life, the Eukarya, the Archaea, and the Bacteria. The domain Eukarya contains organisms that have cells\\nwith nuclei. It includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several kingdoms of protists. The Archaea, are\\nsingle-celled organisms without nuclei and include many extremophiles that live in harsh environments like hot\\nsprings. The Bacteria are another quite different group of single-celled organisms without nuclei (Figure 1.10). Both\\nthe Archaea and the Bacteria are prokaryotes, an informal name for cells without nuclei. The recognition in the\\n1970s that certain “bacteria,” now known as the Archaea, were as different genetically and biochemically from\\nother bacterial cells as they were from eukaryotes, motivated the recommendation to divide life into three domains.\\nThis dramatic change in our knowledge of the tree of life demonstrates that classifications are not permanent and\\nwill change when new information becomes available.\\n12\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nIn addition to the hierarchical taxonomic system, Linnaeus was the first to name organisms using two unique names,\\nnow called the binomial naming system. Before Linnaeus, the use of common names to refer to organisms caused\\nconfusion because there were regional differences in these common names. Binomial names consist of the genus\\nname (which is capitalized) and the species name (all lower-case). Both names are set in italics when they are\\nprinted. Every species is given a unique binomial which is recognized the world over, so that a scientist in any\\nlocation can know which organism is being referred to. For example, the North American blue jay is known uniquely\\nas Cyanocitta cristata. Our own species is Homo sapiens.\\nFIGURE 1.10 These images represent different domains. The scanning electron micrograph shows (a) bacterial cells belong to the domain\\nBacteria, while the (b) extremophiles, seen all together as colored mats in this hot spring, belong to domain Archaea.

A\\nphylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on\\nsimilarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of branch points, or\\nnodes, and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific\\nevidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch can be\\nconsidered as estimates of relative time.\\nIn the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The\\npioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth\\nhas evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Woese proposed the\\ndomain as a new taxonomic level and Archaea as a new domain, to reflect the new phylogenetic tree (Figure 1.11).\\nMany organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To\\nconstruct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape). Various\\ngenes were used in phylogenetic studies. Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes\\nthat are universally distributed, found in some slightly altered form in every organism, conserved (meaning that\\nthese genes have remained only slightly changed throughout evolution), and of an appropriate length.\\n1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology\\n13\\nFIGURE 1.11 This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using genetic relationships. The tree shows the\\nseparation of living organisms into three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Bacteria and Archaea are organisms without a nucleus\\nor other organelles surrounded by a membrane and, therefore, are prokaryotes. (credit: modification of work by Eric Gaba)\\nBranches of Biological Study\\nThe scope of biology is broad and therefore contains many branches and sub disciplines. Biologists may pursue one\\nof those sub disciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology studies biological\\nprocesses at the molecular level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well\\nas the way they are regulated. Microbiology is the study of the structure and function of microorganisms. It is quite a\\nbroad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and\\ngeneticists, among others.\\nAnother field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is\\nconsidered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience.\\nBecause of its interdisciplinary nature, this sub discipline studies different functions of the nervous system using\\nmolecular, cellular, developmental, medical, and computational approaches.\\nFIGURE 1.12 Researchers work on excavating dinosaur fossils at a site in Castellón, Spain. (credit: Mario Modesto)\\n14\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nPaleontology, another branch of biology, uses fossils to study life’s history (Figure 1.12). Zoology and botany are the\\nstudy of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or\\nphysiologists, to name just a few areas. Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products.\\nEcologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments. Physiologists study the workings of cells,\\ntissues and organs. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue. From our own bodies to\\nthe world we live in, discoveries in biology can affect us in very direct and important ways. We depend on these\\ndiscoveries for our health, our food sources, and the benefits provided by our ecosystem. Because of this,\\nknowledge of biology can benefit us in making decisions in our day-to-day lives.\\nThe development of technology in the twentieth century that continues today, particularly the technology to\\ndescribe and manipulate the genetic material, DNA, has transformed biology. This transformation will allow\\nbiologists to continue to understand the history of life in greater detail, how the human body works, our human\\norigins, and how humans can survive as a species on this planet despite the stresses caused by our increasing\\nnumbers. Biologists continue to decipher huge mysteries about life suggesting that we have only begun to\\nunderstand life on the planet, its history, and our relationship to it. For this and other reasons, the knowledge of\\nbiology gained through this textbook and other printed and electronic media should be a benefit in whichever field\\nyou enter.\\nCAREER CONNECTION\\nForensic Scientist\\nForensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists\\nand biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their\\njob involves examining trace material associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last\\nfew years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the\\ndevelopment of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have updated the types of work that\\nforensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape,\\nand assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing\\nDNA (Figure 1.13) found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other\\nbiological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect parts or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers\\nin forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math\\ncourses.\\nFIGURE 1.13 This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory. (credit: U.S. Army\\n1.1 • Themes and Concepts of Biology\\n15\\nCID Command Public Affairs)\\nScientific Ethics\\nScientists must ensure that their efforts do not cause undue damage to humans, animals, or the environment. They\\nalso must ensure that their research and communications are free of bias and that they properly balance financial,\\nlegal, safety, replicability, and other considerations. Bioethics is an important and continually evolving field, in which\\nresearchers collaborate with other thinkers and organizations. They work to define guidelines for current practice,\\nand also continually consider new developments and emerging technologies in order to form answers for the years\\nand decades to come.\\nUnfortunately, the emergence of bioethics as a field came after a number of clearly unethical practices, where\\nbiologists did not treat research subjects with dignity and in some cases did them harm. In the 1932 Tuskegee\\nsyphilis study, 399 African American men were diagnosed with syphilis but were never informed that they had the\\ndisease, leaving them to live with and pass on the illness to others. Doctors even withheld proven medications\\nbecause the goal of the study was to understand the impact of untreated syphilis on Black men.\\nWhile the decisions made in the Tuskegee study are unjustifiable, some decisions are genuinely difficult to make.\\nFor example, bioethicists may examine the implications of gene editing technologies, including the ability to create\\norganisms that may displace others in the environment, as well as the ability to “design” human beings. In that\\neffort, ethicists will likely seek to balance the positive outcomes -- such as improved therapies or prevention of\\ncertain illnesses -- with negative outcomes.\\nBioethics are not simple, and often leave scientists balancing benefits with harm. In this text and course, you will\\ndiscuss medical discoveries that, at their core, have what many consider an ethical lapse. In 1951, Henrietta Lacks,\\na 30-year-old African American woman, was diagnosed with cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Unique\\ncharacteristics of her illnesses gave her cells the ability to divide continuously, essentially making them “immortal.”\\nWithout her knowledge or permission, researchers took samples of her cells and with them created the immortal\\nHeLa cell line. These cells have contributed to major medical discoveries, including the polio vaccine and work\\nrelated to cancer, AIDS, cell aging, and even very recently in COVID-19 research. For the most part, Lacks has not\\nbeen credited for her role in those discoveries, and her family has not benefited from the billions of dollars in\\npharmaceutical profits obtained partly through the use of her cells.\\nToday, harvesting tissue or organs from a dying patient without consent is not only considered unethical but also\\nillegal, regardless of whether such an act could save other patients’ lives. Part of the role of ethics in scientific\\nresearch is to examine similar issues before, during, and after research or practice takes place, as well as to adhere\\nto established professional principles and consider the dignity and safety of all organisms involved or affected by the\\nwork.\\n1.2 The Process of Science\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n•\\nIdentify the shared characteristics of the natural sciences\\n•\\nUnderstand the process of scientific inquiry\\n•\\nCompare inductive reasoning with deductive reasoning\\n•\\nDescribe the goals of basic science and applied science\\n16\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 1.14 Formerly called blue-green algae, the (a) cyanobacteria seen through a light microscope are some of Earth’s oldest life forms.\\nThese (b) stromatolites along the shores of Lake Thetis in Western Australia are ancient structures formed by the layering of cyanobacteria\\nin shallow waters. (credit a: modification of work by NASA; scale-bar data from Matt Russell; credit b: modification of work by Ruth Ellison)\\nLike geology, physics, and chemistry, biology is a science that gathers knowledge about the natural world.\\nSpecifically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers who\\nwork individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social\\nenterprise like politics or the arts. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical and\\nmathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science also\\nrequires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly described as elegant, or\\nbeautiful. Like politics, science has considerable practical implications and some science is dedicated to practical\\napplications, such as the prevention of disease (see Figure 1.15). Other science proceeds largely motivated by\\ncuriosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science, including biology, has transformed human existence and\\nwill continue to do so.\\nFIGURE 1.15 Biologists may choose to study Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterium that is a normal resident of our digestive tracts but which\\nis also sometimes responsible for disease outbreaks. In this micrograph, the bacterium is visualized using a scanning electron microscope\\nand digital colorization. (credit: Eric Erbe; digital colorization by Christopher Pooley, USDA-ARS)\\nThe Nature of Science\\nBiology is a science, but what exactly is science? What does the study of biology share with other scientific\\ndisciplines? Science (from the Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\") can be defined as knowledge about the natural\\nworld.\\nScience is a very specific way of learning, or knowing, about the world. The history of the past 500 years\\ndemonstrates that science is a very powerful way of knowing about the world; it is largely responsible for the\\n1.2 • The Process of Science\\n17\\ntechnological revolutions that have taken place during this time. There are however, areas of knowledge and human\\nexperience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral\\nquestions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science cannot\\ninvestigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and\\nenergy, and cannot be observed and measured.\\nThe scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.\\nThe steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this\\nmethod is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested.\\nHypotheses, or tentative explanations, are generally produced within the context of a scientific theory. A generally\\naccepted scientific theory is thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena.\\nScientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in\\nbiology) there are scientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of\\nnature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to\\nlaws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that\\nscientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories. Laws are concise descriptions of parts of\\nthe world that are amenable to formulaic or mathematical description.\\nNatural Sciences\\nWhat would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences? Frogs? Plants? Dinosaur skeletons? Exhibits about\\nhow the brain functions? A planetarium? Gems and minerals? Or maybe all of the above? Science includes such\\ndiverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics (Figure\\n1.16). However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are\\nconsidered natural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.\\nFIGURE 1.16 Some fields of science include astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.\\n(credit: \"Image Editor\"/Flickr)\\nThere is no complete agreement when it comes to defining what the natural sciences include. For some experts, the\\nnatural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide\\nnatural sciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which\\nstudy nonliving matter and include astronomy, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and\\nbiochemistry build on two sciences and are interdisciplinary.\\nScientific Inquiry\\nOne thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal “to know.” Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces\\nfor the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. Two methods of\\n18\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nlogical thinking are used: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.\\nInductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion.\\nThis type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and\\nrecords them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data\\ncan be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer\\nconclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from\\ncareful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are\\nobserved while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated\\nto be the part controlling the response to that task.\\nDeductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the\\npattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a\\nform of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to predict specific results. From those general principles,\\na scientist can deduce and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid.\\nFor example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and\\nanimals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the\\nmany changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is\\nevidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one.\\nBoth types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and\\nhypothesis-based science. Descriptive (or discovery) science aims to observe, explore, and discover, while\\nhypothesis-based science begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be\\ntested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors\\ncombine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible\\nanswer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based\\nscience are in continuous dialogue.\\nHypothesis Testing\\nBiologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach\\nis common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was\\nused even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626) (Figure 1.17),\\nwho set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but\\ncan be applied to almost anything as a logical problem-solving method.\\nFIGURE 1.17 Sir Francis Bacon is credited with being the first to document the scientific method.\\n1.2 • The Process of Science\\n19\\nThe scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question.\\nLet’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the\\nproblem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That\\nis an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why\\nis the classroom so warm?”\\nRecall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may\\nbe proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air\\nconditioning.” But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be\\nproposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air\\nconditioning doesn’t work.”\\nOnce a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it\\ntypically has the format “If . . . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “If the\\nstudent turns on the air conditioning, then the classroom will no longer be too warm.”\\nA hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear\\nthinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that\\nit can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’s Birth of Venus\\nis beautiful.” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher\\nwill conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A\\nhypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs like\\nmathematics. If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is\\nnot to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be\\nfound to falsify the hypothesis.\\nEach experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. A variable is any part of the experiment\\nthat can vary or change during the experiment. A control is a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for\\nthe variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to\\ntest the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are\\nfilled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by\\nadding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the\\nexperimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with\\nsomething inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding\\nextra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found\\nsupport for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis\\ndoes not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that\\nis not valid (Figure 1.18). Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data\\nare rejected.\\nIn recent years a new approach of testing hypotheses has developed as a result of an exponential growth of data\\ndeposited in various databases. Using computer algorithms and statistical analyses of data in databases, a new field\\nof so-called \"data research\" (also referred to as \"in silico\" research) provides new methods of data analyses and\\ntheir interpretation. This will increase the demand for specialists in both biology and computer science, a promising\\ncareer opportunity.\\n20\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\nFIGURE 1.18 The scientific method is a series of defined steps that include experiments and careful observation.

Sometimes an experiment\\nleads to conclusions that favor a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions\\nto the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw\\ninferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds. Scientific reasoning is more\\ncomplex than the scientific method alone suggests.\\nBasic and Applied Science\\nThe scientific community has been debating for the last few decades about the value of different types of science. Is\\nit valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth\\n1.2 • The Process of Science\\n21\\nif we can apply it to solving a specific problem or bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences\\nbetween two types of science: basic science and applied science.\\nBasic science or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that\\nknowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The\\nimmediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it\\nmay not result in an application.\\nIn contrast, applied science or “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible,\\nfor example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural\\ndisaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.\\nSome individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question these people\\nmight pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A careful look at the history of\\nscience, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many\\nscientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore,\\napplied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move\\non from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that\\nthere are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of\\nthe knowledge generated through basic science.\\nOne example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the\\ndiscovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication.\\nStrands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life.\\nDuring DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding\\nthe mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to\\nidentify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic\\nscience, it is unlikely that applied science could exist.\\nAnother example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which\\neach human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the\\nexact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity represented by a specific DNA segment that\\ncodes for a functional molecule.) Other organisms have also been studied as part of this project to gain a better\\nunderstanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project (Figure 1.19) relied on basic research carried\\nout with non-human organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using\\nthe data for applied research seeking cures for genetically related diseases.\\nFIGURE 1.19 The Human Genome Project was a 13-year collaborative effort among researchers working in several different fields of\\nscience. The project was completed in 2003. (credit: the U.S. Department of Energy Genome Programs)\\nWhile research efforts in both basic science and applied science are usually carefully planned, it is important to note\\nthat some discoveries are made by serendipity, that is, by means of a fortunate accident or a lucky surprise.\\n22\\n1 • Introduction to Biology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nPenicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of Staphylococcus bacteria\\nopen. An unwanted mold grew, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to be Penicillium, and a new critically\\nimportant antibiotic was discovered. In a similar manner, Percy Lavon Julian was an established medicinal chemist\\nworking on a way to mass produce compounds with which to manufacture important drugs. He was focused on\\nusing soybean oil in the production of progesterone (a hormone important in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy),\\nbut it wasn\\'t until water accidentally leaked into a large soybean oil storage tank that he found his method.\\nImmediately recognizing the resulting substance as stigmasterol, a primary ingredient in progesterone and similar\\ndrugs, he began the process of replicating and industrializing the process in a manner that has helped millions of\\npeople. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind\\nfocused on the types of reasoning discussed above—can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.\\nReporting Scientific Work\\nWhether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings for other\\nresearchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Communication and collaboration within and between sub\\ndisciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a\\nscientist’s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting\\nthem at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present.\\nInstead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals.\\nPeer-reviewed articles are scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist’s colleagues, or\\npeers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not\\nthe scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research\\ndescribed in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which\\nare requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists\\ncan reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings.\\nThere are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of online\\nopen-access journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which use rigorous\\npeer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums without peer\\nreview are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientific work. In one exception, journals may allow a\\nresearcher to cite a personal communication from another researcher about unpublished results with the cited\\nauthor’s permission.\\n1.2 • The Process of Science\\n23\\nKey Terms\\napplied science\\na form of science that solves real-\\nworld problems\\natom\\na basic unit of matter that cannot be broken\\ndown by normal chemical reactions\\nbasic science\\nscience that seeks to expand\\nknowledge regardless of the short-term application\\nof that knowledge\\nbiology\\nthe study of life\\nbiosphere\\na collection of all ecosystems on Earth\\ncell\\nthe smallest fundamental unit of structure and\\nfunction in living things\\ncommunity\\na set of populations inhabiting a\\nparticular area\\ncontrol\\na part of an experiment that does not change\\nduring the experiment\\ndeductive reasoning\\na form of logical thinking that\\nuses a general statement to predict specific results\\ndescriptive science\\na form of science that aims to\\nobserve, explore, and find things out\\necosystem\\nall living things in a particular area\\ntogether with the abiotic, nonliving parts of that\\nenvironment\\neukaryote\\nan organism with cells that have nuclei\\nand membrane-bound organelles\\nevolution\\nthe process of gradual change in a\\npopulation that can also lead to new species arising\\nfrom older species\\nfalsifiable\\nable to be disproven by experimental\\nresults\\nhomeostasis\\nthe ability of an organism to maintain\\nconstant internal conditions\\nhypothesis\\na suggested explanation for an event,\\nwhich can be tested\\nhypothesis-based science\\na form of science that\\nbegins with a specific explanation that is then tested\\ninductive reasoning\\na form of logical thinking that\\nuses related observations to arrive at a general\\nconclusion\\nlife science\\na field of science, such as biology, that\\nstudies living things\\nmacromolecule\\na large molecule typically formed by\\nthe joining of smaller molecules\\nmolecule\\na chemical structure consisting of at least\\ntwo atoms held together by a chemical bond\\nnatural science\\na field of science that studies the\\nphysical world, its phenomena, and processes\\norgan\\na structure formed of tissues operating\\ntogether to perform a common function\\norgan system\\nthe higher level of organization that\\nconsists of functionally related organs\\norganelle\\na membrane-bound compartment or sac\\nwithin a cell\\norganism\\nan individual living entity\\npeer-reviewed article\\na scientific report that is\\nreviewed by a scientist’s colleagues before\\npublication\\nphylogenetic tree\\na diagram showing the\\nevolutionary relationships among biological species\\nbased on similarities and differences in genetic or\\nphysical traits or both\\nphysical science\\na field of science, such as\\nastronomy, physics, and chemistry, that studies\\nnonliving matter\\npopulation\\nall individuals within a species living\\nwithin a specific area\\nprokaryote\\na unicellular organism that lacks a\\nnucleus or any other membrane-bound organelle\\nscience\\nknowledge that covers general truths or the\\noperation of general laws, especially when acquired\\nand tested by the scientific method\\nscientific law\\na description, often in the form of a\\nmathematical formula, for the behavior of some\\naspect of nature under certain specific conditions\\nscientific method\\na method of research with defined\\nsteps that include experiments and careful\\nobservation\\nscientific theory\\na thoroughly tested and confirmed\\nexplanation for observations or phenomena\\ntissue\\na group of similar cells carrying out the same\\nfunction\\nvariable\\na part of an experiment that can vary or\\nchange\\nChapter Summary\\n1.1 Themes and Concepts of Biology\\nBiology is the science of life.

They form the carbohydrates,\\nnucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (all of which will be defined later in this chapter) that are the\\nfundamental molecular components of all organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss these\\nimportant building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements\\naffect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.\\nFood provides an organism with nutrients—the matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical\\nnutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life.\\nThese macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What\\nspecific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules\\nformed? What functions do they serve? In this chapter, we will explore these questions.\\nFIGURE 2.1 Foods such as bread, fruit, and cheese are rich sources of biological macromolecules. (credit:\\nmodification of work by Bengt Nyman)\\nCHAPTER OUTLINE\\n2.1 The Building Blocks of Molecules\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n•\\nDescribe matter and elements\\n•\\nDescribe the interrelationship between protons, neutrons, and electrons, and the ways in\\nwhich electrons can be donated or shared between atoms\\nAt its most fundamental level, life is made up of matter. Matter occupies space and has mass. All\\nmatter is composed of elements, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed\\nchemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of\\nprotons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur\\nnaturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and,\\ntherefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected.\\nEach element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses\\nunique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each\\nother in specific ways.\\nAtoms\\nAn atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of\\nthat element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen,\\nsuch as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water\\nmolecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the\\nproperties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would\\nno longer have the properties of hydrogen.\\nAt the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms\\nthat combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules\\ncan interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These\\ncombinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.\\nAll atoms contain protons, electrons, and neutrons (Figure 2.2). The most common isotope of\\nhydrogen (H) is the only exception and is made of one proton and one electron with no neutrons. A\\nproton is a positively charged particle that resides in the nucleus (the core of the atom) of an atom\\nand has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An electron is a negatively charged particle that travels in\\nthe space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible\\nmass and has a charge of –1.\\nFIGURE 2.2 Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons surrounding the\\nnucleus.\\nNeutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge.\\nThe positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom,\\nwhich has a net zero charge.\\n28\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nBecause protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and\\nneutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so\\nsmall.\\nAs stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and\\nneutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. The atomic number of an element is equal to the\\nnumber of protons that element contains. The mass number, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the\\nnumber of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting\\nthe atomic number from the mass number.\\nThese numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements\\nhave different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They\\nalso combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is\\nbased on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the\\nperiodic table of elements, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of\\neach element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements (Figure 2.2)—often\\nindicated by color-coding. The arrangement of the table also shows how the electrons in each element are\\norganized and provides important details about how atoms will react with each other to form molecules.\\nIsotopes are different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of\\nneutrons. Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12,\\nthe most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12\\n(six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons\\nand eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of\\n6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are\\nunstable and will lose protons, other subatomic particles, or energy to form more stable elements. These are called\\nradioactive isotopes or radioisotopes.\\n2.1 • The Building Blocks of Molecules\\n29\\nVISUAL CONNECTION\\nFIGURE 2.3 Arranged in columns and rows based on the characteristics of the elements, the periodic table provides key information about\\nthe elements and how they might interact with each other to form molecules. Most periodic tables provide a key or legend to the\\ninformation they contain.\\nHow many neutrons do (K) potassium-39 and potassium-40 have, respectively?\\nEVOLUTION CONNECTION\\nCarbon Dating\\nCarbon-14 (14C) is a naturally occurring radioisotope that is created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays. This is a\\ncontinuous process, so more 14C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of 14C in\\nits body is equal to the concentration of 14C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting 14C,\\nso the ratio will decline. 14C decays to 14N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process.\\nAfter approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of 14C will have been converted to 14N.\\nThe time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-\\nlife. Because the half-life of 14C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the\\n14C concentration found in an object to the amount of 14C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope\\nthat has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be calculated to about\\n50,000 years (Figure 2.4). Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are used to calculate the ages of\\nolder fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the ecology and biogeography of\\norganisms living within the past 50,000 years.\\n30\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nFIGURE 2.4 The age of remains that contain carbon and are less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can be\\ndetermined using carbon dating. (credit: Bill Faulkner/NPS)\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nTo learn more about atoms and isotopes, and how you can tell one isotope from another, visit this site\\n(http://openstax.org/l/isotopes) and run the simulation.\\nChemical Bonds\\nHow elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings for\\nelectrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy levels that\\nform shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is\\nalways filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot\\noccupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its\\ntwo electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in\\nthe first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two\\nelements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.\\nThe second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and\\none position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed.\\nLooking at the periodic table again (Figure 2.3), you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to\\nthe number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing\\nnumbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of\\nshells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table,\\nyou will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne).\\nThese all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost\\nshell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is\\nthe case with neon.\\nNot all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable when all of the\\nelectron positions in the outermost shell are filled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost shells, we see the\\nformation of chemical bonds, or interactions between two or more of the same or different elements that result in\\nthe formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely fill their outer shells and will\\nbond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting electrons from another atom, or\\ndonating electrons to another atom. Because the outermost shells of the elements with low atomic numbers (up to\\n2.1 • The Building Blocks of Molecules\\n31\\ncalcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is referred to as the octet rule. An element can\\ndonate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.\\nWhen an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an ion. Because the number of\\nelectrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing\\nelectrons and are called cations. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called anions.\\nFor example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one\\nelectron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11\\nprotons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.\\nThe chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one\\nelectron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons and 18 electrons,\\ngiving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of electrons from one element to\\nanother is referred to as electron transfer. As Figure 2.5 illustrates, a sodium atom (Na) only has one electron in its\\noutermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate\\nits one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom will accept that electron to fill its shell, becoming chloride.\\nBoth ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no\\nlonger equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or –1 (chloride) charge.\\nFIGURE 2.5 Elements tend to fill their outermost shells with electrons. To do this, they can either donate or accept electrons from other\\nelements.\\nIonic Bonds\\nThere are four types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Ionic\\nand covalent bonds are strong interactions that require a larger energy input to break apart. When an element\\ndonates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The\\nelement accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions\\nstay together and form an ionic bond, or a bond between ions. The elements bond together with the electron from\\none element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na+ and Cl– ions combine to produce NaCl, an\\nelectron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions\\nattract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.\\nCovalent Bonds\\nAnother type of strong chemical bond between two or more atoms is a covalent bond. These bonds form when an\\nelectron is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond in living\\norganisms. Covalent bonds form between the elements that make up the biological molecules in our cells. Unlike\\n32\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate in water.\\nThe hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds. The\\nelectron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete\\nouter shell of the oxygen atom. To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two\\nhydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H2O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing\\ntheir time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms\\ninvolved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.\\nThere are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. Nonpolar covalent bonds form between two atoms of\\nthe same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally. For example, an oxygen atom can\\nbond with another oxygen atom to fill their outer shells. This association is nonpolar because the electrons will be\\nequally distributed between each oxygen atom. Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because\\noxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also\\ncalled triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its\\noutermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH4) molecule. The carbon\\natom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen\\natoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent\\nbonds (Figure 2.6).\\nIn a polar covalent bond, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the\\nother nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+)\\nor slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are\\npolar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus, giving it a small negative\\ncharge, than they spend near the hydrogen nuclei, giving these molecules a small positive charge.\\nFIGURE 2.6 The water molecule (left) depicts a polar bond with a slightly positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and a slightly negative\\ncharge on the oxygen. Examples of nonpolar bonds include methane (middle) and oxygen (right).\\nHydrogen Bonds\\nIonic and covalent bonds are strong bonds that require considerable energy to break. However, not all bonds\\nbetween elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur\\nbetween positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. Two weak bonds that occur\\nfrequently are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. These bonds give rise to the unique properties of\\nwater and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.\\nWhen polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a slightly positive\\ncharge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the\\nhydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ+), it will be attracted to neighboring negative\\npartial charges (δ–). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ charge of the hydrogen atom of\\none molecule and the δ– charge of the other molecule. This interaction is called a hydrogen bond. This type of bond\\nis common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by the hydrogen bonds between water molecules\\n(Figure 2.7). Hydrogen bonds give water the unique properties that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding,\\n2.1 • The Building Blocks of Molecules\\n33\\nwater would be a gas rather than a liquid at room temperature.\\nFIGURE 2.7 Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive (δ+) and slightly negative (δ–) charges of polar covalent molecules, such as\\nwater.\\nHydrogen bonds can form between different molecules and they do not always have to include a water molecule.\\nHydrogen atoms in polar bonds within any molecule can form bonds with other adjacent molecules. For example,\\nhydrogen bonds hold together two long strands of DNA to give the DNA molecule its characteristic double-stranded\\nstructure. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for some of the three-dimensional structure of proteins.\\nvan der Waals Interactions\\nLike hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. They\\noccur between polar, covalently bound, atoms in different molecules. Some of these weak attractions are caused by\\ntemporary partial charges formed when electrons move around a nucleus. These weak interactions between\\nmolecules are important in biological systems.\\nCAREER CONNECTION\\nRadiography Technician\\nHave you or anyone you know ever had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a mammogram, or an X-ray?\\nThese tests produce images of your soft tissues and organs (as with an MRI or mammogram) or your bones (as\\nhappens in an X-ray) by using either radiowaves or special isotopes (radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled) that are\\ningested or injected into the body. These tests provide data for disease diagnoses by creating images of your organs\\nor skeletal system.\\nMRI imaging works by subjecting hydrogen nuclei, which are abundant in the water in soft tissues, to fluctuating\\nmagnetic fields, which cause them to emit their own magnetic field. This signal is then read by sensors in the\\nmachine and interpreted by a computer to form a detailed image.\\nSome radiography technologists and technicians specialize in computed tomography, MRI, and mammography. They\\nproduce films or images of the body that help medical professionals examine and diagnose. Radiologists work\\ndirectly with patients, explaining machinery, preparing them for exams, and ensuring that their body or body parts\\nare positioned correctly to produce the needed images. Physicians or radiologists then analyze the test results.\\nRadiography technicians can work in hospitals, doctors’ offices, or specialized imaging centers. Training to become a\\nradiography technician happens at hospitals, colleges, and universities that offer certificates, associate’s degrees, or\\nbachelor’s degrees in radiography.\\n2.2 Water\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n•\\nDescribe the properties of water that are critical to maintaining life\\nDo you ever wonder why scientists spend time looking for water on other planets? It is because water is essential to\\nlife; even minute traces of it on another planet can indicate that life could or did exist on that planet. Water is one of\\n34\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nthe more abundant molecules in living cells and the one most critical to life as we know it. Approximately 60–70\\npercent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist.\\nWater Is Polar\\nThe hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend\\nmore time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water\\nmolecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen\\natom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape\\nseen in Figure 2.7. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative\\ncharges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming\\nhydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred\\nto as hydrophilic (“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and\\nfats (Figure 2.8). These nonpolar compounds are hydrophobic (“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.\\nFIGURE 2.8 As this macroscopic image of oil and water show, oil is a nonpolar compound and, hence, will not dissolve in water. Oil and\\nwater do not mix. (credit: Gautam Dogra)\\nWater Stabilizes Temperature\\nThe hydrogen bonds in water allow it to absorb and release heat energy more slowly than many other substances.\\nTemperature is a measure of the motion (kinetic energy) of molecules. As the motion increases, energy is higher\\nand thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy\\ndisrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly,\\nwater absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates\\ntemperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between\\nhydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are\\nformed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body\\nof water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called evaporation. Evaporation of sweat,\\nwhich is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of\\nenergy and takes heat away from the body.\\nConversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen\\nbonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g.,\\nice) (Figure 2.9a). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that\\nice floats on the surface of a body of water (Figure 2.9b). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of\\nthe water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this\\ndid not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making\\nlife in cold temperatures difficult or impossible.\\n2.2 • Water\\n35\\nFIGURE 2.9 (a) The lattice structure of ice makes it less dense than the freely flowing molecules of liquid water.

Water is, therefore, what is referred to as a solvent—a substance capable of dissolving another\\nsubstance. The charged particles will form hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules. This is\\nreferred to as a sphere of hydration and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. In the case\\nof table salt (NaCl) mixed in water (Figure 2.10), the sodium and chloride ions separate, or dissociate, in the water,\\nand spheres of hydration are formed around the ions. A positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially\\nnegative charges of oxygen atoms in water molecules. A negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the\\npartially positive charges of hydrogen atoms in water molecules. These spheres of hydration are also referred to as\\nhydration shells. The polarity of the water molecule makes it an effective solvent and is important in its many roles\\nin living systems.\\nFIGURE 2.10 When table salt (NaCl) is mixed in water, spheres of hydration form around the ions.\\n36\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nWater Is Cohesive\\nHave you ever filled up a glass of water to the very top and then slowly added a few more drops? Before it overflows,\\nthe water actually forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because\\nof the property of cohesion. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen\\nbonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-air (gas) interface, although there is no more room in the\\nglass. Cohesion gives rise to surface tension, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupture when placed under\\ntension or stress. When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water\\ndroplet, although the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is\\ncreated by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating\\non the top. It is even possible to “float” a steel needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently, without\\nbreaking the surface tension (Figure 2.11).\\nFIGURE 2.11 The weight of a needle on top of water pulls the surface tension downward; at the same time, the surface tension of the water\\nis pulling it up, suspending the needle on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking. Notice the indentation in the water around\\nthe needle. (credit: Cory Zanker)\\nThese cohesive forces are also related to the water’s property of adhesion, or the attraction between water\\nmolecules and other molecules. This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will\\nnotice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water\\nmolecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it.\\nCohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life. For example, because of these forces, water can flow\\nup from the roots to the tops of plants to feed the plant.\\nLINK TO LEARNING\\nTo learn more about water, visit the U.S. Geological Survey Water Science for Schools: All About Water! website.\\n(http://openstax.org/l/about_water)\\nBuffers, pH, Acids, and Bases\\nThe pH of a solution is a measure of its acidity or bascicity. You have probably used litmus paper, paper that has\\nbeen treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much acid or base\\n(basicity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to make sure the water in an outdoor swimming pool\\nis properly treated. In both cases, this pH test measures the amount of hydrogen ions that exists in a given solution.\\nHigh concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. The\\noverall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on the pH scale (Figure\\n2.12). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher\\nthe pH.\\nThe pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of\\nhydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by\\na factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations of hydrogen ions. Pure\\n2.2 • Water\\n37\\nwater is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic, and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is\\nacidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in your veins is slightly alkaline (pH = 7.4).\\nThe environment in your stomach is highly acidic (pH = 1 to 2). Orange juice is mildly acidic (pH = approximately\\n3.5), whereas baking soda is basic (pH = 9.0).\\nFIGURE 2.12 The pH scale measures the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) in a substance. (credit: modification of work by Edward Stevens)\\nAcids are substances that provide hydrogen ions (H+) and lower pH, whereas bases provide hydroxide ions (OH–)\\nand raise pH. The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H+. For example, hydrochloric acid and lemon juice\\nare very acidic and readily give up H+ when added to water. Conversely, bases are those substances that readily\\ndonate OH–. The OH– ions combine with H+ to produce water, which raises a substance’s pH. Sodium hydroxide and\\nmany household cleaners are very alkaline and give up OH– rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.\\nMost cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only from 7.2 to 7.6.\\nIf the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do other organs in the body.\\nCells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside of the pH range can induce coma\\nor even cause death.\\nSo how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key. Buffers readily\\nabsorb excess H+ or OH–, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforementioned narrow range.\\nCarbon dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the human body; it keeps the pH within the proper range. This\\nbuffer system involves carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3–) anion. If too much H+ enters the body,\\nbicarbonate will combine with the H+ to create carbonic acid and limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH–\\nis introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly dissociate into bicarbonate and H+ ions. The H+ ions can\\ncombine with the OH– ions, limiting the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction,\\nits presence is fleeting because the carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we\\nbreathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our bodies would fluctuate too much and we would fail to survive.\\n38\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n2.3 Biological Molecules\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n•\\nDescribe the ways in which carbon is critical to life\\n•\\nExplain the impact of slight changes in amino acids on organisms\\n•\\nDescribe the four major types of biological molecules\\n•\\nUnderstand the functions of the four major types of molecules\\nThe large molecules necessary for life that are built from smaller organic molecules are called biological\\nmacromolecules. There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\\nnucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined,\\nthese molecules make up the majority of a cell’s dry mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning they\\ncontain carbon and are bound to hydrogen, and may contain oxygen, nitrogen, and additional minor elements.\\nCarbon\\nIt is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other\\nelements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things.\\nOther elements play important roles in biological molecules, but carbon certainly qualifies as the “foundation”\\nelement for molecules in living things. It is the bonding properties of carbon atoms that are responsible for its\\nimportant role.\\nCarbon Bonding\\nCarbon contains four electrons in its outer shell. Therefore, it can form four covalent bonds with other atoms or\\nmolecules. The simplest organic carbon molecule is methane (CH4), in which four hydrogen atoms bind to a carbon\\natom (Figure 2.13).\\nFIGURE 2.13 Carbon can form four covalent bonds to create an organic molecule. The simplest carbon molecule is methane (CH4),\\ndepicted here.\\nHowever, structures that are more complex are made using carbon. Any of the hydrogen atoms can be replaced with\\nanother carbon atom covalently bonded to the first carbon atom. In this way, long and branching chains of carbon\\ncompounds can be made (Figure 2.14a). The carbon atoms may bond with atoms of other elements, such as\\nnitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus (Figure 2.14b). The molecules may also form rings, which themselves can link\\nwith other rings (Figure 2.14c). This diversity of molecular forms accounts for the diversity of functions of the\\nbiological macromolecules and is based to a large degree on the ability of carbon to form multiple bonds with itself\\nand other atoms.\\n2.3 • Biological Molecules\\n39\\nFIGURE 2.14 These examples show three molecules (found in living organisms) that contain carbon atoms bonded in various ways to other\\ncarbon atoms and the atoms of other elements. (a) This molecule of stearic acid has a long chain of carbon atoms. (b) Glycine, a component\\nof proteins, contains carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. (c) Glucose, a sugar, has a ring of carbon atoms and one oxygen atom.\\nCarbohydrates\\nCarbohydrates are macromolecules with which most consumers are somewhat familiar. To lose weight, some\\nindividuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to\\nensure that they have sufficient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our\\ndiet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the\\nbody, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans,\\nanimals, and plants.\\nCarbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.\\nIn other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are\\nclassified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.\\nMonosaccharides (mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In\\nmonosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end\\nwith the suffix -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may be known as trioses (three\\ncarbon atoms), pentoses (five carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).\\nMonosaccharides may exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions, they are usually\\nfound in the ring form.\\nThe chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6. In most living species, glucose is an important source of energy.\\nDuring cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine\\ntriphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis, and\\nthe glucose, in turn, is used for the energy requirements of the plant. The excess synthesized glucose is often stored\\nas starch that is broken down by other organisms that feed on plants.\\nGalactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although\\nglucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C6H12O6), they differ structurally and\\nchemically (and are known as isomers) because of differing arrangements of atoms in the carbon chain (Figure\\n2.15).\\n40\\n2 • Chemistry of Life\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\n'"
